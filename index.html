                    <h3>Full-Time Job</h3>
                    <p>
                        I work full-time in software quality-assurance testing and software development for a government contracting organization. I perform manual and automated testing of multiple applications written in various .NET frameworks. To perform testing, I use tools from <a href="https://smartbear.com/">SmartBear</a> such as TestComplete and TestExecute (automated testing) and Zephyr Scale (manual testing). I also work on web application development in a platform called <a href="https://appian.com/">Appian</a> which is a low-code system that uses pre-built tools such as interfaces, reports and data types to build robust solutions. I am currently in transition from a testing role to a development role. I also work extensively in requirements gathering and analysis, and UX/UI design. On the internal corporate side, I have also worked in marketing, which was a great opportunity to employ some of my skillsets in social media and graphic design.        
                    </p>

                    <h3>Primary Hobby</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I am a hobbyist sketch and graphic design artist who creates illustrations, both hand-drawn (primarily using pencil) and digital (using tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, Adobe Illustrator). This activity is a long-time interest of mine, as I find it very fulfilling and a great way of expressing one’s ideas and perceptions of reality. I aspire to put some of this work to use in casual and professional settings. Casual settings may include wearables (such as T-shirts, hats, or posters), while a professional setting could include corporate graphic design. I believe consumers can benefit from using my artwork to color, customize and invigorate their environments. A more general audience could enjoy viewing the material as a medium of creative communication.
